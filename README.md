#Gameplay

Objective:

As a wizard, your goal is to complete a few short quests given by NPCs around the world. Each quest is stolen/modified from the sample quests in gbstudio.

Controls:

    D-Pad: Move your wizard in the game world.
    A: Interact with NPCs, open doors, or pick up items.
    B: Cast the selected spell.
    Select: Open the spell menu to equip or switch spells.
    Start: Pause the game.

Quests:

In this demo, you’ll encounter three main quests to help you learn and unlock new spells. Some quests may involve exploring areas, finding hidden items, or defeating simple enemies.
Example Quests:

    Turnip Trouble – Murder an innocent turnip.
    Sneak aboard a spaceship – Sneak onto a motherfucking spaceship.
    Find some dudes cat – Talk to the dude and go find his cat.

Spells:

You’ll start with two basic spells, and you can unlock two additional spells through quests. Each spell has a unique effect that helps you complete tasks, defeat enemies, or solve puzzles.

    Ball – A basic spell; useful for fending off small creatures. Does 1 damage.
    Duck – I didn't know what to do for the other spell, so it's just duck. Same as the other spell, but you shoot ducks.
    fire spell – A fire spell that does 2 damage. For reference, the turnip only has like 4 health. (unlocked via quest).
    Portal thing? – Kinda like the bfg in doom, after talking to a dog in space you get this cool spell that does 4 damage. (unlocked via quest).

Tips and Tricks:

    Experiment with shit: Some spells can interact with the environment in obvious ways. Like the unlit torch next to that old man.
    Talk to everyone: NPCs often give clues about quests or hidden items.
    Fuck mana, we ain't doing a mana system in this game. Might not even do a leveling system at all since it's pissing me off rn.

Known Issues and Limitations:

    This is an early demo, so expect a few bugs, particularly with quest tracking and spell interactions.
    Some areas you may not be able to use spells in. I'd like to make a more open world next.
    Since it's in gbstudio you have to space out enemies. You can't have more than 4 moving actors.
    But with the player and procjectiles you "cast", it feels more like 2.
